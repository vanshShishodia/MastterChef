Nutella® Cream Cheese Pound Cake
Not your traditional pound cake, but dense and creamy just like the original. This uses cream cheese and yogurt instead of butter for a bit of tang then gets swirled with Nutella® for a rich cocoa and nutty addition. It also contains less sugar.
1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
¾ teaspoon baking powder
½ cup white sugar
½ cup cream cheese, at room temperature
½ cup full fat plain yogurt, at room temperature
3 eggs, at room temperature
½ teaspoon vanilla bean paste
¾ cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
